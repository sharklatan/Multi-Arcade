version 2.25

2.25	NEOGEO
	Updated drivers. Thanks to Wesker, MR-J and the rest of people 
	in speksnk.net boards
	Unlocked games up to New Power Instinct Matrimelee
	Fixed garou raster effect missing in pre-battle talk
	Added proper neopcm2 decryption

	NEOGEO-CD
	Some code has been rewritten to improve compatibility. Now
	more games should work (although there are still some problems).
	Added an option in the Emulation menu for direct load of neocd ISO 
	or CD.
	
	PGM
	Added Knights of Valour 2 and Knights of Valour 2: Nine Dragons. Thanks
	to HappyASR for the help getting the dump of the internal cartridge
	cpu program. Due to the extra processor required to emulate, the game
	will require a more powerful PC to run. Also savestates won't work.
	(Internet ranking mode for kof2nd has been intentionally disabled).
	Music speed in kov2/kov2nd is a bit off.
	Fixed wrong sprite zoom and shrinking (required for kov2nd)
	Fixed sprite priorities handling (required for kov2 & kof2nd)
	Added protection for PhotoY2k.	

	CPS2
	Updated drivers. Thanks to Wesker, MR-J and the rest of people 
	in speksnk.net boards

2.24
	NEOGEO
	Fixed all the neogeo roms to match MAME romsets (Thanks to 
	Wesker from Speksnk for the work).
	Fixed kof98 protection (delete old kof98.srm files from
	your config folder)

	GENERAL
	Added HQ2x plugin (includes src in plugins\hq2xsrc.zip)

2.23d
	NEOGEO CD
	Fixed broken neogeo CD in the previous version
	Fixed some protection issues in Soccer Brawl, I hope
	it also fixes the Disc I/O errors.

	PGM
	Fixed broken pgm support in previous version

	GENERAL
	Hopefully fixed the .dat files

2.23c
	CPS2
	Added new cps2shock xor tables
	Added 'Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon 2003' game.

	NEOGEO
	Fixed some problems with multislot emulation when there were
	empty slots between 2 used slots.
	Synced game drivers and bios names with latest MAME.

2.23b
	CPS2
	Added Mighty! Pang (Japan 001011)
	Added Super Street Fighter 2 (ETC 930911)

	NEOGEO
	Added Jockey Grand Prix. The sound program rom is
	encrypted, so I've used vliner as parent and took
	its m1 rom while we get a decrypted dump.

	GENERAL
	Added a new frameskip code, it should perform better on slower
	machines

2.23a
	GENERAL
	Fixed the NOREPEAT flag not working in winamp jukebox lists.

2.23
	CPS2
	Added 1944: The loop master (US 000620)
	
	GENERAL
	Improved the winamp jukebox feature, check the sample.trk file
	in TRACKLST for an explanation.

2.22a
	Seems that the 2.22 version was leaked before release 
	with some bugs in the main core and the d3d plugin so
	I've named this version as "a" to avoid confusion.

	GENERAL
	Added a Winamp jukebox option. Be careful as it's a
	bit different than how Kawaks works. You'll need to create
	a music mapping table (check the sample kof98.TRK file in 
	TRACKLST directory) and nebula will replace the
	sound codes you indicate by the mp3/cd track/ogg/wav/...
	you specify in that file. You must have winamp running
	before loading a game that you created track lists for.
	The option to enable/disable it is in the Sound menu.
	It only works with Winamp 2.x.

	Improved the video plugin interface to support rendering
	plugins.
	Added a preliminary graphics renderer based in Direct3D. I highly
	recommend using it if you want to run in 32 bit desktop
	or play rotated games (19xx,dimahoo) as it is a lot
	faster than the Hardware Blit one in these cases.
	Also it has some projection features and any bright
	scanlines. Scanlines doesn't work well with rotated
	games.
	You'll need a video card with the following features:
		- non square textures
		- non power of 2 textures
		- textures bigger than 256x256 pixels (sorry, no voodoo)
	

	NEOGEO
	- Fixed "Step Frame" button in the shots factory
	- Added King of Fighers 2001 driver

	CPS1
	- Fixed "Step Frame" button in the shots factory
	- Fixed Mega Twins music speed.
	- Fixed missing sprites in Forgotten Worlds
	- Fixed games crashing on 32 bit desktop

	CPS2
	- Added Marx Matrix drivers.
	- Fixed wrong flash frames in MvsC.
	- Fixed some Dimahoo cheats not working (from
	the latest Mike_Haggar cheat collection file)
	- Fixed games crashing on 32 bit desktop

2.21b
	GENERAL
    Fixed a severe bug in the startup code that caused nebula
    to allocate huge amounts of RAM for absolutely no use on
    startup. This was causing crashes in WinXP/2k and wrong
    graphics decryption in big neogeo games.

2.21a
	CPS2
	Added new XOR tables for
		- Dimahoo (US 000121)
		- Great Mahou Daisakusen (Japan 000121)
		- Battle Circuit (Euro 970319)
	Changed Battle circuit parent set to Euro version.

	NEOGEO
	Fixed Neogeo CD support broken in last version.

2.21
	CPS1
	Fixed crashing in Punisher in the 2nd stage boss.	

	CPS2
	Improved VBlank timing. Fixes some problems with SFA3.
	
	NEOGEO
	Added support for the Universe BIOS. Go to Game->Neogeo Options
	and enable "Use Universe BIOS" to load it. The bios must be in
	a zip named uni-bios.zip (in the ROMS folder) and the rom 
	MUST be named uni-bios.rom. When using universe bios, all neogeo
	options and cheats in nebula will be disabled, use the bios built-in
	region, machine type and cheats options. When using universe
	bios you'll see garbage during initial tests, don't worry, that's
	normal and doesn't cause any other problem.
	Fixed slowdowns in s1945p.

	GENERAL
	Fixed crashings if you have more than 4 joysticks connected.

2.20
	CPS2
	Fixed some sprite/BG desyncs in Gigawing.
	Fixed SFA3 crashing with latest Mike Haggar's cheats.

	CPS1
	Added a bunch of SF2 hacks (not all fully working though).

	GENERAL
	Added highscore saving for CPS2 games. Not all games are added yet.
	Almost all CPS2 games are supported, and some CPS1 too.
	It will use an external database to store the highscore data.
	You can convert a MAME Hiscore.dat file to nebula's internal DB
	with the command "nebula -hiconv" having the hiscore.dat file in the
	nebula dir, it will build HISCORES.DB in the HISCORES dir. You should
	delete all the .HI files to avoid problems when you change the HISCORE DB.
	To turn off hiscore saving, just delete HISCORES.DB from the HISCORES dir.

1.19c
	CPS1
	Fixed all CPS1+QSound games crashing after load.

	CPS2
	Added new decryption tables
		- Giga Wing (US 990222)
		- Giga Wing (Japan 990223)
		
1.19b
	NEOGEO
	Fixed Fatal Fury 2 protection not working
	Fixed VLiner not working
	Fixed Alpha Mission 2 missing sounds
	Added 6 slot support for Multi slot MVS emulation.
	Added Bangbead encrypted romset.

	CPS2
	New xors
		- Megaman 2: Power Fighters (US 960708)
		- Street Fighter Zero 2 Alpha (Asia 960826)
		- X-Men: Children of the Atom (Asia 941217)

	CPS1
	Fixed wrong tiles on 1st floor of Magic Sword

2.19a
	PGM
	Fixed gfx glitches in Dragon World 2
	Fixed zooming (very noticeable in dragwld2 intro)
	Fixed missing parts of some sprites (KOV flashes)

	CPS1
	Fixed some remaining music speeds...

	NEOGEO
	Fixed Garou missing animations (esp. some Grant moves).
	Select button should be working in all games now (not only garou).
	Added the game slot switch button to switch games
	forwards (key 9=switch backwards, key 0=switch forwards)

	GENERAL
	Fixed (hopefully) Romcenter Dat generation.


2.19
	PGM 
	Added Dragon World 2 (it has some gfx glitches due to some missing parts in
	the protection emulation)
	Text layer should now be correctly aligned (it was 1 line too high)

	CPS2
	Fixed ssf2xj timing that was still wrong.
	
	NEOGEO
	Fixed small autoanimation problems
	Added neogeo multislot MVS emulation. 
	Usage: 
		in the rom loading screen, you'll see a dropbox to 
		select in which neogeo slot you want to load the game.
		Just select the slot and hit load, then after loading a
		game, you can go and load another in a different (or the
		same, overriding it) slot.
		Note that you'll need a lot of RAM to hold all games in 
		memory at the same time.
		To switch from game to game, use the button mapped as
		Button 5 in the input options (default key 0)
		The current bios supports 4 game slots.
		The default bios config only allows to switch games after
		inserting a coin. To change it, press F2, go to "set the soft
		dips", then "setting the cabinet", and change "Game selection"
		to "Free".
		Using savestates with multislot games may have unpredictable
		results.
		ALWAYS LOAD IN THE 1ST SLOT FIRST.

2.18b
	NEOGEO
	Fixed some sound timming issues with long samples (Dandy J stage in wakuwak 7)
	Switched the memory card format to MAME one (old memcards still work).

	CPS1
	Fixed slow music in pang3 and megaman.


2.18a
	NEOGEO
	Fixed mslug3nd driver crashing nebula.
	Fixed kof99d driver. now it loads the decrypted C roms instead of
	the prototype roms.


2.18
	PGM
	Improved sound volume (checked with Z80 volume tables).
	Improved music speed (checked with real sound samples. Thanks to BillyJr).
	Fixed some wrong objects in KOV.

	CPS1
	Fixed incorrect music speed in some games (still some remaining)
	Dipswitches in all CPS1 games were wrong. They are (should) be
	correct now. (remember that CPS1 dips are changed in the Cheats menu)
	Fixed some sprite clipping problems.

	CPS2
	Added Vampire Hunter 2 and the rest of the latest CPS2Shock releases

	NEOGEO
	Fixed garou select button
	Fixed garou 3rd Terry stage background animation (requires rasters enabled)
	Fixed garou random character selection.
	Fixed sound problems in ssidekicks4 and neobomberman
	Improved raster emulation with the info from the real HW.
	Now nebula should not complaing about wrong ng-lo.rom files.
	Fixed sound problems ninja combat, ninja commando and others. Big thanks
	to Acho A. Tang.
	Fixed KOF94 Japan stage intro.
	Recent neogeo games have been locked. You should go to an arcade
	if you want to play them.
	Fixed kof2knd C7 rom (seems that only I had that rom)
	Added an additional sengoku3 romset for the new P1 (it's not 
	clear what's the correct one).
	ND romsets no longer use the encrypted P roms, they are
	fully decrypted.

	GENERAL
	Added an option to auto switch to Fullscreen after loading a ROM (Misc menu)
	Corrected Nebulaconfig looping in the options screen.

2.17
	PGM
	Improved sound emulation:
		Volume should be correct (or almost) now.
		Note pitch improved.
	Fixed missing background in a KOV stage.
	Added an option to capture the current music to a file
	to load it in jukebox (PZM files).
	Calendar is disabled when netplay or recording movies. This 
	will (should :)) avoid desyncs.

	CPS2
	Fixed some finish specials being wrong in the bottom of
	Manhattan stage in mshvsf.

	CPS1
	Fixed missing helicopters and buildings in cawing.
	
	NEOGEO
	Fixed (again) sengoku3 decrypted driver.
	Fixed Irritating Maze controls. You can use the mouse to 
	move the rod (this game cabinet has a trackball).
	Fixed missing 2 lines at the bottom of the screen of games
	using rasters (most noticeable in mslug2, galaxyf, mosyougi)
	
	GENERAL
	Added some language translations (Italian, Korean, Chinese, Dutch)
	Fixed 50% scanlines at 640x480
	Added a "Step Frame" button to the shot factories (window mode)
	Added some Force Feedback tables by Iron Man.
	Added a small skin option to the windowed GUI. Any PNG file in
	the SKINS folder will be randomly chosen and displayed in the 
	nebula window on startup when no game is loaded.

	IMPORTANT!! I've received a lot of mails asking about neo-geo.rom,
	ng-lo.rom and ng-sfix.rom. Those are the neogeo bios and MUST be
	ZIPPED in a file named NEOGEO.ZIP in the ROMS folder (or any roms
	folder you have configured).

	

2.16
	PGM
	Z80 is fully emulated, that means, correct sounds and music
	in games. The sound chip emulation is not 100% accurate so
	some notes in music are wrong. I've added an option to disable
	the music in the Options menu.
	Fixed savestates in KOV games. (old savestates will still not
	work, only new ones will be correct).
	Fixed text layer position being wrong by 1 line.
	Added shot factory (F8)

	CPS2
	Fixed a palette sync problem that caused part of the charlie
	stage in sfa2 flash out of sync.
	Scanlines in 640x480 are now correct (again). Use No stretch go
	get them correctly.

	NEOGEO
	Fixed sengoku3 decrypted driver.

	GENERAL
	Added language switch for the menus (check the english.lng
	file in the skins dir for a template for translation)
	

2.15a
	PGM
	Fixed Knights of valour missing platform and bridges in some
	stages.
	Some rom renamings. To match mame names
		sango1   -> kov
		sango1_5 -> kov115
		sango1_9 -> kovplus
		orlegend -> orlegend (the same)
		orleg112 -> orlegnde
		orleg12e -> orlegndc
	Fixed china and taiwan regions swapped in KOV
	
	NEOGEO
	Fixed savage reign V2 rom CRC
	Added Sengoku3 and Zupapa neogeo drivers.

	GENERAL
	PGM resolution is very wide, so if it's cut in the
	screen, play a bit with stretch options till you can
	get it fitting.

2.15
	PGM
	Added Knights of Valour and Knights of Valour Plus 
	(see KOVROMS.TXT for the correct roms CRC and sizes).
	Special thanks to BillyJr for his help to get this
	game running.
	Added Sound emulation. Well, it's not complete emulation, but
	it's enough go get sounds working. Only SFX works and some
	sounds may be wrong. 
	Added region switch to orlegend and kov
	Fixed orlegend crashes.
	NOTE: PGM games have a very wide resolution so
	double size modes (scanlines and most image enhancement
	modes) require resolutions higher than 800x600 to work
	properly with no stretch.

	GENERAL
	Fixed netplay crashing with Konami and PGM games.

2.14b
	CPS1
	Fixed wrong layer offsets in sf2yyc and kouryu (=blackbelt? ) that
	appeared due to the new timing.
	Fixed Quiz and Dragons USA gfx problems
	Fixed sound problems in ADPCM audio (oops, my fault, I
	left some test code inside).

	GENERAL
	Fixed Nebula hanging in a window when exiting a game
	in the classic GUI.
	Fixed the Video menu crash if there are no transparency tables in
	the CONFIG folder.

2.14a	
	CPS1
	Fixed loops in some drivers (cworld2j, qad and qtono2)
	that were causing the rom scanning crash

2.14

    	CPS1
	Fixed high music speed in sf2 and captcomm
	Added the missing CPS1 drivers (thanks to 
	mike_haggar haggar.emuunlim.com)

	PGM
	Fixed the memory corruption bug in orlegend (aka
	infinite lives bug)
	Fixed zooming (it was reversed, making zoom effect
	backwards :) )
	Fixed screen cut with some blitters.

	CPS2
	Re-adjusted timing again, now some games are smoother
	(especially ssf2t)

	GENERAL
	Added Force feedback support, using tables. I've
	included 2 sampe tables (xmvsf.ht2 and mvsc.ht2). Read
	the comments in them to know how to make your own tables.
	To make .FFe files you'll need MS force editor that comes
	with directx sdk. It hasn't been too much tested so there
	might be bugs, let me know if you found any and/or if you
	make a force table. Remember to enable and map your
	devices to the correct player in the options window.
	Added a control layout load/save feature to save your
	favourite layouts (as the save/load default layout never
	worked corectly). I've included some layouts for keyboard,
	6 button pads and hotrod (thanks Crashtest).
	Fixed errors when changing DSP plugins while the game was
	running.
	Fixed a small bug in the winamp wrapper plugin. Now more
	winamp DSP plugins work (like DFX 6.0, RTEQ, Pacemaker)
	Added an HyperBass DSP plugin (just in case you want to break
	your subwoffer).
	Fixed Keep aspect video option. To get a clean scanlines
	Image (no stretch distortion), I recommend using 800x600 with
	no stretch.
	Added 3 new gfx blitters. Bilinear interpolators, that override
	the older Full and light interpolation ones. The effect is the
	same (bilinear light=light interp. Bilinear=full interp) but
	they are twice faster.

2.13a
    NEOGEO
    Fixed Spinmasters gfx errors on the bottom lines (raster bug)

    CPS1
    Added SF2 KouRyu driver

    CPS2
    Improved CPU timing. That makes SSF2T/SSF2X smoother.
    Fixed SSF2X driver (no more gfx or sound problems)

    PGM
    Fixed crashing after a few minutes playing.

    GENERAL
    Added SuperScale blitter (similar to a *Scale blitter
    of other CPS2 emu :) ). It looks great and it's very
    fast (if not the fastest) image enhancement mode. Full source included.
    The best blitter in nebula without any doubt. It only works
    in 16-bit desktop modes.
    Added auto-transparencies. It will make flickering objects
    and meshes become transparent without blur. The 50% frame blend
    blitter is no longer needed. Unlike sprite transparencies,
    this will cause a performance hit, so better don't enable it
    if you have a slow computer.
    Fixed full interpolation mode.

2.13
    NEOGEO
    Improved raster effects emulation.
    Most games are correct now, and others
    have been greatly improved:
	mosyougi title
	ssidekicks pitch (still not 100% correct but
			  heh, at least you can see it)
	samsho3 "3D" floor effects
	wheroes floors
	karnovr floors
	mslug3 last boss red sky distortion
	galaxyfight better alignment

    CPS2
    Added latest CPS2Shock releases
    Fixed wrong layer prios on nwarr character
    selection screen.

    KONAMI & CPS1
    Fixed music speed that was wrong in some games.

    PGM
    Optimized sprite drawing (more than twice
    faster now in some critical parts)
    Fixed sprite shrinking
    Added sprite zooming
    Added linescroll (orlegend stage 4 and 6)
    Fixed some missing sprites (clipping problems)
    Main CPU is running at the correct speed now

    
    GENERAL
    Added DSP plugins support (including a DSP
    wrapper for winamp plugins. It's still beta
    so be careful, and don't change the plugin
    while a game is running)
    The plugin.h file has been update with the 
    DSP plugin interface.
    Force feedback support is disabled as I'm 
    improving it (and it's still not finished :( )
    


2.12
    CPS1
    Fixed dynasty wars romset names
    Fixed sprites disappearing.

    NEOGEO
    Fixed mslug3nd romset.

    GENERAL
    Fixed Scanlines when using 640x480.

2.11
    KONAMI
    Added Bucky O'Hare
    Fixed Zooming.
    Fixed some sprite gfx problems (2nd level boss
    in moo)

    CPS2
    If you are only seeing 2 buttons in CPS2 games
    delete the .dat file for that game in the
    CONFIG folder.

    CPS1
    Added SF2 YYC hack

    NEOGEO
    In the ROMDATA folder you'll find a
    file called Neogeo.new. Delete the
    Neogeo.dat and rename the .new to .dat
    to use the new MAME rom names.
    It's a good moment to remember that if
    you have nebula reporting missing neo-geo.rom
    ng-sfix.rom or ng-lo.rom, you'll need to put
    the neogeo.zip file (BIOS) in a roms
    directory (folder).

    GENERAL
    Fixed Vertical games not displaying anything.


2.1	
    KONAMI
     Mooooo!!
	Added Wild West COW Boys of Moo Mesa.
	
	CPS1
	Added Dynasty Wars (World), it's now the
	parent set.

	CPS2
    Fixed SFA3 crashing with Mike Haggar's cheats.
	
	NEOGEO
	Added NeoPong
	Fixed Neogeo CD Metal Slug crashes

	GENERAL
	Added an option to  auto-Switch to 16 bit desktop
	color depth (Misc Menu)
     Fixed Menu bar flickering in fullscreen.
     Changed the ROMdata files format, to a
     more compact format. Also now all romsets
     are external (Except Konami), so you can
     rename/edit the romsets to match yours.
     I strongly recommend that you delete the old
     .DAT files from the ROMDATA folder.
	
	

2.0a

	BUG FIXES
	Fixed old GUI crashing on start
	Fixed title bar corruption
	Fixed Aspect ratio with Keep aspect option
	Fixed vertical games on 32 bits desktop.
	Fixed ingame menu letters when using 32 bit
	color depth
	Fixed xmvsf crash on start bug.

	Added shot display on Rom List when moving
	with arrow  keys
	Added a Switch to Fullscreen option in the
	Video Menu, as some people didn't know how
	to switch to fullscreen (ALT-Enter)

	Added many transparency tables. Thanks to
	Darksoul, Bad_crc, Razoola, kyo_99 and 
Ken_Masters. 

Some things I forgot to mention in the readme:
- To use the old gui, you can also launch:
    Nebula.exe -classic (-window  if you want  to
    run it  in a window))
- You can click on the column names in the rom list
    to sort the list using that column.

	
2.0
	GENERAL
	Lots of changes in this version, but the most
	noticeable one is the new Window mode
	GUI (You can still use the old GUI). Note that 
the window mode will workin systems with 32 bpp 
desktop color depth	but only Hardware blit will work.
If Nebula runs very very slow, try disabling stretch and
Switching to system memory allocation.

	Due to the big amount of changes I'd recommend
	that you read all the docs.

	Some keys behave differently in window mode GUI
	check the GENERAL doc.

	Major rewrite of the main core. All systems
	emulation have experienced a speedup and
	the memory requirements have been lowered
	a lot.

	New shots factories, that allows changing almost
	every parameter/sprite. Please, read the doc about
	this.

	New macro code, that allows macros to work without
	knowing the character addresses and also adds
	"global" macros that can be used with any character
(read macros documentation).
	
	NEOGEO
	Added 4-point interpolation for Delta-T samples.
	Added a decryption progress indication for
	latest  (encrypted GFX) games.
	Sengoku3 and Zupapa are disabled. The Find
	Roms trick will no longer work.
	Small fix to rasters that were wrong by 1 line (still
	few raster games work ok)

	CPS1
	Added knightsh, dinoh and wofh hacks. Take note
	that there are some glitches in those games
	due to some roms that aren't dumped yet.

	CPS2
	Rewritten GFX code. It's the fastest and most
	accurate code in all nebula versions. It fixes all
	known glitches (esp. Rowscroll ones: avsp, ryu
	stage of sf2/ssf2).

	Very accurate raster emulation. A lot faster than the
	old one, and now accurate at line-level. This
	new raster code emulates the missing background
	distortion in Shuma Gorath's Chaos Dimension
	on msh and mshvsf.

	Fixed mvsc sprite misalignment in ending sequence.

	Added a pre amplification option to QSound 
	renderer. 	I don't recommend using it because
	can cause distortion with higher volume samples.
	Use it only if the sound output is too low in your 
	system.
	

1.97
	
	NEOGEO
	- Fixed SS3 protection. You must delete the
	Samsho3.dat file in the CONFIG folder.

	CPS1
	- Fixed some sprite wraparound bugs that still
	remained.

	GENERAL
	- Added sprite transparency support, using
	external tables. Read the Transparency.txt file
	to know more about them, and how to make your
	own tables. There are some tables included, but more
	will come, also if you want to share your tables,
	send them to me and I'll include them in the release.
	- Added 50% Frame Blend (and +scanlines) gfx renderer
	that removes flickering sprites making them transparent.
	- Fixed movie recording.
	- Rewritten graphics core to use DirectDraw 3, that
	is faster in older video cards and will probably
	fix some hang bugs.
	- Added a configuration screen for nebula.ini
	options. Launch Nebulaconfig.exe or Nebula.exe -config.
	- Added autofire option for all buttons in all games.
	- Separated hotkey configuration for Neogeo and CPS.

1.96

	NEOGEO

	- AT LAST!!! Fixed the nasty bug that
	caused nebula hang with a plain color
	screen (red/blue/black), hanging the
	computer. As result of this fix, the
	drawing operations are slightly faster.

	CPS1 (heh, here we go...)

	- Added starfield planes emulation in
	strider and forgotten worlds backgrounds
	- Fixed forgotten worlds shop bug.
	- Fixed sprite flickering/disappearing
	in many games (dino, strider, kod,...)
	- Fixed bad tiles scattered in some
	games (3wonders, unsquad, area88)
	- Fixed sprite palette desyncs
	(3wonders golem tree)
	- Fixed Daimakaimura black screen.
	- Fixed dinoj and punishj crash.
	- Fixed sound hanging in most games.
	- Improved ADPCM decoding, now there is
	no sound distortion.
	- New GFX drawing engine, slightly faster
	than before.
	- With all those fixes, CPS1 emulation is
	almost 100% complete. Please, report the
	bugs you find.

	CPS2
	
	- New GFX drawing engine, slightly faster
	than before.
	- Added Rockman region and cheats (sorry,
	I forgot to include it in the previous
	release).
	
	GENERAL

	- Added movie recording for all systems.
	Use the in-game menus or the keys:
	   SHIFT-F10 Record Movie
	   SHIFT-F11 Play Movie
	   Press any of the above keys while 
	   recording or playing to Stop.
	- Fixed sound configuration lost when
	going to the game GUI.

1.95d

	NEOGEO
	- Fixed garou romsets:
		garou.zip (set 1) (Main set, needs the 
				   new 253-sma.bin)
		garouo.zip (set 2) (Old set, uses the 
				   old 253-smao.bin,
				   parent: garou.zip)
		garoud.zip (Decrypted C set, 
			    parent: garou.zip)

	- Added MSlug3 (Encrypted set) (needs 256-sma.bin)
	- Fixed kof99p P1 rom CRC.
	- Fixed sound samples loading for games with 
	  gaps in the sound roms (kof95 missing tracks)
	
	GENERAL
	- Changed some rom names in sync with kawaks and
	  MAME. There are still some small differences,
	  mainly in CPS1 romsets.
	- Fixed romcenter dat generation. Now it includes
	  merge info.
	- Fixed cheat engine parser to allow longer lines
	  to fix problems with the great cheat collection 
	  released by Mike Haggar (haggar.emuunlim.com).
	- Added more language packs


1.95c

	NEOGEO
	- Added Garou (set 1), note that romset names
	have changed to match current  mame names:
	    Garou (Set 1)  -> garou.zip
	    Garou (Set 2)  (old garou.zip) -> garouo.zip
	That renaming should not cause problems with
older naming because nebula will scan both files
for the required roms.

- Fixed sound problems with very short samples.
  Mostly noticeable in kof2k K' team ending.
  Thanks to all the people that sent me their
  save states.

GENERAL
- More languages added.
- External font added, with some special chars
  now available (á,é,ñ,ç, etc...) a font editor is
  in the work.

1.95b

	NEOGEO
	- Fixed kof2000 (Not encrypted) that was being
	  decrypted, sorry for the problems.
	- Fixed alpha mission 2 romset to match the 
	  latest redump

	GENERAL
	- Added Chinsese (Simplified, GUI only) ,Italian 
	  Russian (gui only) and French languages. Please, 
  if you make a language file, send it to me to add 
  it to the official release. (You can put your name
	  in the file, as comments starting with ';').

1.95

	NEOGEO
	- Fixed at last (I hope) kof99.
	- Added MSlug3 (Not encrypted).
	- Added Garou: Mark of the wolves (Encrypted)
	- Added Kof2000 (Original set) version, 
  thanks to Nicola Salmoria for the new tables.
- Fixed GFX decrypting tables
- Added the new S rom banking needed for Garou
and Mslug 3
	- Fixed rasters in some games 
	  (Parallax scroll in Zedblade)
	- Fixed sound state restoring when loading an state.

	NEOGEO CD
	- NOTES: 
- If you are having frameskip problems in the 
BIOS intro, just insert a CD in your currently 
selected CD drive.
- If the in-game GUI hangs when going to the 
cd options menu, configure the cd manually in
the GENERAL.DAT file in the CONFIG folder
(NeoCDMode=  0-CD  1-ISO)

	CPS1 
	- Fixed sound state restoring when loading an state.

	GENERAL
	- Fixed crashing when changing the sound options
	while playing.
	- Added 48000 Hz sampling rate.
	- Added Language support. You will be able to
	  translate almost all Nebula text strings
	  using .lng files in the SKINS directory.
	  Use the original (English.lng) file as a 
	  template. Remember that the graphics font
	  for in-game menus has only standard 7-bit 
	  ASCII chars, so chinese, japanese or special
	  language letters will not be possible in
	  that menus.

1.94b

	NEOGEO
	- Changed kof2000 romset names to kof2000.zip  and kof2000n.zip.
	- Fixed console mode for nitd and kof2000
	- Added support for romsets with decrypted C roms
	- Fixed kof99 and kof99d graphics

	CPS2
	- Fixed a Directsound 3D bug that was causing strange problems (I forgot
	  to add an EMMS opcode at the end of the MMX code)

	GENERAL
	- Slowdowns while connected to internet or using other audio programs in
	  background *should* be mostly fixed now.
	- Added an option in Nebula.ini to show the sound codes stack, useful to find
	  codes for Force Feedback.


1.94
NEOGEO CD:
- Fixed NeoGeo CD game always reported as missing (Red)
- Fixed some loading screens that caused emulation crash (mslug,windjammers, 
  and many more.)
- Fixed ISO+MP3 crashes
- Fixed kof99 crashing (Nebula was messing with the NeoGeo romset and was trying 
  to decrypt the code :) )
- Modified the NeoGeo CD docs, I hope they are clearer now.

NEOGEO:
- Added King of Fighters 2000 (decrypted set). You'll need the Neo-0 dump (kof2k) and
  the decrypted dump (kof2kn.zip).
- Removed Metal Slug 3 from the gamelist since it was causing some confusion.
- Added 512 Kb S rom support (Huge thanks to Mr K for his help :) )
- I forgot to thank Nicola in the previous version. Many thanks to him for making possible
  playing new NeoGeo Games.
- Sengoku 3 is NOT SUPPORTED. This game is only 4-5 months old and it's still in the
  arcades.
- Changed the gfx decryption method, it should be faster and will require less memory as 
   now it's performed before loading any other roms (program or sound).
- If there is not enough memory to perform the decryption, games will run with encrypted
  graphics. This behaviour was also in the previous release, but I forgot to write it here.

CPS2:
- Fixed 4 point interpolation equation that was causing some sound artifacts in high pitched
  sounds.
- Added the new QSound code to the Directsound 3D renderer (I forgot to add it in the
  previous version).
- Slightly faster Z80+QSound emulation by removing some unneeded FP operations.
- Fixed Directsound 2d Narrow mode always being Mono, now it's Stereo.

CPS1:
- Fixed Nemo (Japan) always appearing in the gamelist.

GENERAL
- Added Hotkeys documentation that was missing in latest releases.


1.93	
	NEOGEO CD:
	- Added support for NeoGeo CD games. You'll need a game CD or a ISO+MP3 image. 
	- You'll need the NEOCD.BIN file in a file called NEOCD.ZIP, (512Kb, CRC: df9de490) and 
	  the NG-LO.ROM in the NEOGEO.ZIP file.
	- To play a NeoGeo CD game, launch the "Neogeo CD" game that appears in the gamelist.
	  this will start the neogeo cd, press A button to go to the player or start to start the game.
	  to configure CD emulation (CD or ISO image), press ESC and go to "CD options".
	  No savestates or cheats are available for NeoGeo CD.
	  NeoGeo CD emulation has still some bugs. If you get a "Disc I/O Error", exit to the GUI and
	  run the "NeoGeo CD" game again.

	NEOGEO:
- Fixed rasters for some games (ridhero, galaxy fight, neo turf masters, top hunter, ddragon)
- Added Vliner emulation. Check the special button configuration for this game 
  in the controls menu.
- Added Kof99, Prehistoric Isle 2, Ganryu, Strikers 1945 Plus and Nightmare in the Dark 
  graphics decryption, using MAME's decryption algorithm (that means that some gfx may 
  be wrong as the algorithm may be incomplete)

	CPS2:
	- Fixed mshvsf VS screen top lines being drawn upside down.
	- Fixed Cheats and region for mshvsf.
	- Added VSAV2 rom data file
	- Rewritten Qsound emulation engine. Written in MMX optimised ASM it's now 3-4 times
	  faster and more accurate. It also has a new interpolation mode that uses 4 points instead
	  of 2. It requires more CPU power, but sounds better.

	GENERAL:
	- Fixed the usage of parent cheats if a clone has no specific cheat data. Now Region is
 	  never taken from the parent cheat, and cheat configuration is stored in the clone dat file.
	- Removed some games from the internal database that caused problems with the new
	  dump names.
	- Fixed some Force Feedback problems
	- Fixed surface memory allocation. Now nebula requires much less VRAM to work.
	- Added separate audio configuration for each system (Qsound, Neogeo and CPS1)


1.92	
	NEOGEO:
	- Preliminary Neogeo Raster effects Added. Please note that Rasters are disabled by 
default in NEBULA.INI because they are SLOW, set the EnableNGRasters option to 1 
to enable  them. The Super Sidekicks games and some other games have still some raster 
problems.
	- Adjusted (again) the Z80 sound timing.
	- Added fatfury2 protection (many thanks to Mr K).

	CPS2:
	- Fixed BlackHeart's stage of MSH missing rowscroll in the background (there are now 
	  too many hacks in the raster code, it needs an urgent rewrite :) )
	- Better sprite timming and sprite buffering that solves some backgrond/sprite
	  desync (ssf2 portraits, ecofght, sfa3,...)
	- Fixed the CPS2 eeprom problems that caused problems with some games (csclub, 	  
	  ssf2t,...)
	- Fixed Super Hyper turbo :) mode for ssf2t, I accidentally left the CPS2 CPU clock
	  running at 20 Mhz.

	CPS1:
	- Fixed Mercs graphics.

	GENERAL:
	- Improved the cheat engine with conditional cheats, indirect addressing (for neogeo), 
	  etc. Check the CHEATS.TXT file for info.

	- If there is no specific cheats for a clone, nebula will take the cheats form the parent set.
	  That removes the need of a cheat file for every clone.

- Added force feedback support. Some fighting games allow detecting the hits, so 
	  nebula will use force feedback to make you "feel" the hits. In the CONFIG directory
	  there are two .ffe files with the force data that can be edited with Microsoft FEdit
	  to make your own force macros.
	  Force info is still only available for xmvsf. I'll post info for more games soon if this
	  feature is showed useful.
	  Note that player 1 force is sent to joy 1 and player 2 to joy 2, so you may have to  rearrange
	  your joysticks ports to make it correct.

	


1.91b	- Fixed kof99 (and some other games) sound "clicks".
	- Due to a stupid bug, the new delta-t interpolator was no enabled in
	previous versions (they were using the old one).
	- Now Ninja Commando and Ninja Combat music sometimes work (and sometimes
	doesn't :( )
	- 640x480 scanline modes are now centered on the screen.

1.91a
Fixed macro support that was broken in previous version.
Fixed a stupid bug in default control, hotkeys and macros that prevented
it from working.
Fixed the size and crc for the NG-LO.ROM file, it should be 64k
(65536 bytes) and CRC: E09E253C. It's the same than the old dump
but with only the first 64k (last 64k are a copy of the first 64k)
Nebula will still recognize the old 128k rom.
I forgot to mention an experimental option in nebula, it's the -blade15
option, it will generate 15Khz output signals (for arcade monitors) if
you have a Trident Blade3D card. You'll need the BLADEIO.VXD file from the
Blade15khz package in http://www.beimborn.com/mame/dl/blade15_24.zip (mirror 
because the original page is about to disappear).


1.91	Added a "Smart" romset name recognition, you must enable it setting
StrictRomsets=0 in NEBULA.INI and then use the "Find Neogeo" button in
	the OTHERS menu. It will recognize the romsets with different names
	than the MAME ones but the files (size, CRC) must be MAME compilant.
	If nebula is unable to find a match with its internal database it will
	try to build a new romset (similar to Neoragex import feature) with
	the files in the zip. Nebula can recognize MVS and MGD dumps, so your
	old romsets will work now. Note that that feature may cause gfx or
	game problems because the neogeo dumps aren't homogeneus, so don't
	mail me about gfx or game problems if you aren't using strict name
matches. Remember to hit Scan Roms after looking for neogeo roms.
	Corrected X Zoom tables with values checked in the original board.
	Corrected Y Zoom tables (You'll need to have the ng-lo.rom file
	inside your NEOGEO.ZIP file).
	Balanced AY and YM volumes.
	New interpolation mode for Frecuency control type (Delta-t) ADPCM
	sound samples, this one is better (and faster) for high pitched 
	samples	(for example arina or dandy j's stages in Wakuwak7).
	Delta-t samples were always interpolated in previous versions, now 
	interpolation for these samples is only used if it's enabled in 
	the menu. (Having interpolation disabled is faster, but sounds 
much worse (many audible resampling artifacts) I recommend having
interpolation always enabled (it's not much slower))
	Added the new Kof99 decrypted set (kof99d), you'll need files from
	the 3 kof99 romsets, read the MINIFAQ.
	Fixed double dragon (and probably many more) FMV intro sound 
	problems.
	Added Hotkeys. Configure the button mapping for each hotkey in the
	HOTKEYS.DAT file (there are separated configs for CPS and neogeo games)
	and then assign keys in the Control menu to the 6 Hotkeys available (scroll
	down the control menu to see the keys).
	Added a new stretch mode called "Keep aspect" that keeps the original
	aspect while using the bigger possible screen area (good for vertical games).
	Added FreePlay switch to the Machine Settings menu.
	Added a Control configuration menu for GUI keys, you can map there
	the keys you want to use to move the cursor in the GUI/Game menus.
	This menu is shown when you select the CONTROL menu and there is no
	game selected. To deselect the currently selected game, press the
	right mouse button or the button assigned to "Back" in the GUI keys
	menu.
Rewritten the rom checking code. Now it's faster and has a progress
bar. Anyways, I recommend not to have AutoAnalyze enabled in NEbula.ini
due to the big amount of romsets supported, better use the Scan Roms
button when you add new roms.

1.9	Added a MINIFAQ file, please read it.
	Fixed Neo Turf Masters driver that crashed nebula in the loading
	screen.
	Fixed puzzle bobble romset name to match the latest MAME name.
	Fixed w2k crashes when pressing the TAB key.
	Fixed misc crashes on startup in video cards with little VRAM
	Fixed DDTOD and DDSOM F2 key.
	Fixed the savestate time being always GMT.
	Fixed crashes when using ALT-TAB to switch task.
	Fixed Irritating Maze controls, now it works.
	Neogeo s1 and m1 roms with wrong sizes are now accepted and loaded.
	Added triple buffer option to video options.
	ALT-ENTER key now also works in the GUI.
	Removed 400x300 resolution from neogeo and added 320x240 as it's
	closer to the real res (304x224).
	Rewritten default controls code, now it works with all games, but
	you'll need to re-map the keys again.
	Added an option to disable debug dipswitches because they were
	causing problems in some games. 
		NOTE: Mixing debug switches with Developer mode may cause 
		strange results. If the game has a strange behaviour 
		(fights ending without fighting in rbffs) you must clear 
		the SRAM (by either deleting the game .srm file in the 
		EEPROM dir or going to Test menu, Hardware test press Start 
		till you see the Clear backup RAM screen and then Press 
		the buttons A,C and C simultaneously (default Z,X,C).
	Added an overclocking option for neogeo games in the machine settings menu.
	The overclock setting is stored for each game. Overclock only the games
	that actually need it (mslug2,mslugx for example)
	Fixed a major bug in savestate saving/loading code that caused nebula crash 
	when loading states. Sound will not be restored when loading previous 
	version savestates to avoid crashes.
	I forgot to state in the previous version that the neogeo bios
	MUST be in a file called neogeo.zip (neogeod.zip for the debug BIOS)
	in any roms folder.

1.8	New system emulated: Neo·Geo. Read the NEOGEO.TXT file for more information.
	New autoframeskip code. It's much better than the older one. Now games should
	run better than before in slower computers.
	Please note that the working of UseMask in NEBULA.INI was changed
	in the previous version, read the updated comments in NEBULA.INI.
	Added options in NEBULA.INI to disable the joystick and sounds of the GUI.
	New menu system (press ESC during gameplay) to access the different windows
	available for each system (savestate, loadstate, cheats...)
	All game windows have been enhaced with new fonts and colors, they are
	more readable (and look a lot better :) )
	Re-added (again) the scanlines modes for 640x480, please, note that not all
	of the other modes work correctly in this resolution in CPS (1 and 2) games, 
	so be careful. Neogeo games will work ok with any mode in this resolution.
	Video options can be customized for each emulated system (CPS Horizontal,
	CPS Vertical and Neogeo).
	Added the (experimental) -window option, that lauches nebula in a window. Use
	this option only if your desktop color depth is set to 16 bits. Also you can
	switch between window and fullscreen while playing using ALT-ENTER.
	Added the -romcenter option that creates a Romcenter Datafile (Nebularomcenter.dat)
	

1.7	Switched to Mike Coates' A68K core, it's faster and more accurate. Due
	to this change, some of the old savestates may not work (I've tested
	all my savestates and all worked).
	Rewritten critical parts of the main emulation core, graphic tile drawers
	and sound emulation. This should cause a major speedup.
	Fixed the wrong pitch and tempo of the sound.
	Added a new sound mode (Dsound2d Narrow), it's faster but has less
	surround effect.
	Sound is now saved in CPS1 games.
	Fixed sound saving problems in CPS2 games.
	Added a powerful macro and hint system. Read the file MACROS.TXT. Hints
	are only visible if you are using 800x600 and no stretch. Macros and
	hints can be disabled in the OTHER options panel.
	To show the macro config keys, use the new arrows in the CONTROLS menu
	3wonders black squares fixed.
	Fixed game list slider, now it works better.


1.6a	Fixes hanging after loading some games in fast computers.
	Most CPS1 sound problems fixed
	Vertical scanlines mode and Hardware blit no MMX are now accesible
	Ghouls'n Ghosts black square problems fixed.
	Most CPS1 QSound game clones are working now.
	Added Street Fighter 2 World Warrior and clones (not all clones tested)
	I forgot to mention in the last version that I've fixed the sound pitch
	and playing speed. The sound is now closer to the arcade.

1.6	Wow, lots of changes...
	ADDED PRELIMINARY NETPLAY SUPPORT USING KAILLERA :). Use the -knet option
	or the NebulaNet.exe file.
	Fixed CPS1 background color selection.
	Added most CPS1 games (there are still some missing)
	Added more dipswitches
	Sound state in CPS1 games is not saved/loaded now, I'm trying to
	fix some problems with it.
	Fixed some CPS1 gfx glitches (3wonders black squares are still there)
	Faster rotated games. Now they are almost as fast as horizontal
	ones (Thanks Mr K :) )
	Much faster scanline modes.
	Faster 2xZoom.
	Added new image enhacement modes: Super2xSaI, 2xSaISuperEagle,
	2xSai 75% scanlined (Thanks again to Mr K for this last one :) )
	Added Vertical Scanlines mode.
	Fixed Eagle support that was broken some versions ago.
	Removed scanline modes in 640x480. You must use higher resolutions
	to enable them.
	Added 384x224 and 768x448 resolutions. You can only use them
	if you video card supports them. (there are some patches out there
	that can enable these resolutions in some cards).
	Added an AutoAnalyze option in the NEBULA.INI file to avoid
	nebula analyzing romsets on startup.
	Added the Default option in Cheat files.
	Sounds in the GUI.
	SFZ3 characters and backgrounds animations fixed.
	PrioEngine option removed from NEBULA.INI, it's no longer needed.
	And lots changes that I can't remember...	
	NOTE: to get ssf2tb working, hit F2 when the "Terminal check" words
	appear and in the game option set the game to Single Mode

1.5a	Fixed Alien vs Predator backgrounds.
	Fixed ssf2xj gfx problems. Note that now ssf2xj is a child of ssf2t, so you don't
	need the gfx roms in the ssf2xj.zip.
	Some notes: 
		-PLEASE, READ THE COMMENTS IN NEBULA.INI FILE as they have important
	information on how to setup the nebula gfx engine to be more accurate.
		-Zip file support in skins is only for skin developers. They can pack the gui 
	image files in zip files instead of using the -packgui to produce the .dat file.
	
1.5	Added CPS1 support. Not all games have been added yet. Note that you CAN'T add CPS1
	games via dat files.
	Written a new sprite graphics code that correctly handles the sprite priorities and
	sprite masking (this code is disabled by default as it's slower, enable it in 
	NEBULA.INI).
	Added some tricks to emulate the sprite masking with the old (and faster) gfx code, 
	note that this code is disabled by default (see NEBULA.INI) due to problems in
	some games (morrigan in vsav).
	Added a NEBULA.INI file with special configurations (read this file to know the
	things you can configure).
	Added skin selector in the OTHER menu (skins must be in the SKINS\ directory). The
	name displayed is the name of the .zip or .dat file containing the skin. You can
	use long filenames (but not very long, 20 char max).
	Support for up to 10 different ROM directories.
	Support for skins in zip files.
	Fixed the bug that truncated skins files to 512KB.
	Added a pink background option in the Shots factory.
	Too many internal changes that I can't remember.

1.4a	Fixed Slammasters black backgrounds.
	Fixed sound interpolation not working and added a filter (now 44100 Hz sounds better)
	Added volume change emulation with the '-' and '=' keys (next to the Backspace). The 
	volume level is saved per game.
	Fixed hangups when changing pantalla.raw

1.4	Some rom files has been renamed to match the latest CPS2MAME rom names.
	Ability to filter the game list. You can select if you want to seel all games, or only the
	available ones.
	Roms now aren't analyzed everytime Nebula starts. They are checked when romsets are changed
	or when you press the Rescan button in the OTHER config screen.
	Changed main 68000 core to Bart Trzynadlowski's Genital 68k, which is a bit faster than
	starscream, and has less bugs (perhaps none).
	Rewritten the layer 2 drawing code. Rowscrolling problems are almost fixed (only missing
	avsp intro). It has caused a small slowdown, but with the little speedup of the main core
	the speed should be the same as before.
	19xx gfx problems fixed at last. If you use old savegames, then the problems will not
	be fixed until a stage change in the game.
	As some people has reported that the new gfx code (v1.3 and later) is slower than the older
	one (1.2 and before), then I've added the ability to use the old gfx code using the -oldgfx
	command line option.
	Sprite priority code has back to the original code that causes less gfx problems.
	Implemented sprite bankswitching (one of the still unemulated features of the cps2 hardware)
	Added PNG unfiltering modes (Sub,Up,Avg,Paeth). PNG files created with other tools
	should look right now.
	Fixed most Raster problems. Things look a lot better. Only remaining some sprite problems.
	Changed the Savegame format. Now the sound is correctly restored when loading a savegame. The
	old format is still recognized and loaded.
	Data files (configuration and savegames) are not encrypted anymore. If you want info about
	the format of these files, send me an E-mail.
	Fixed the "controller setting forgetting" bug. It's fixed now, but it requieres that you
	delete the old config files.
	Added the ability to save the controller data as the default mapping for games using
	the same button layout.
	GUI graphics can be changed (see -packgui option and the section below).
	

1.3	Fixed some rowscrolling problems (there are still many errors yet, but I know the cause)
	New sprite priority code. Now all seems ok.
	Added Auto Save/Load, that saves/load the game state on exit/entry.
	Screenshot format switched to PNG. (older shots are automatically converted)
	Frameskip value is stored.
	In the GUI you can draw the slider to move the list.
	Added wheel mouse support.
	Pause button mutes the sound.
	Changed the graphic modes for 19xx, now it's more "pixel perfect".
	A final comment, due to many questions I've received. The best sounding mode is
	Interpolated 22050 Hz (not 44100 Hz), this is due to the fact that the code is
	optimized for that mode and using higher frequencies result in a loss of sound quality.

1.2a	(this version was a quick fix to play Powered Gear, but wasn't released. I prefer wait
	and release a version with more fixes)
	Emulated the math part of the graphics chip (used by Powered Gear)
	Increased the number of cheats per game (100 cheats, with 100 states per cheat and 32 values per state)

1.2	Rewritten the drawing routines. It should be faster now. Thanks Raz.
	Another try to solve the s3 graphics problem.
	Added again the Light Interpolation and Full Interpolation modes (use 640x480 res)
	Added some enhacement modes to 640x480 (scanlines and scanlines 50%)	
	Added the ability to use the audio jukebox in games without decryption tables.
	Changed the naming of some romsets to be compatible with MAME ones.
	Added vsync option.
	Added 1280x960 resolution.

1.1     Raster effects!!. Preliminary. Some games have graphic glitches.
        Ssf2 y ssf2t work perfectly.
        Added the 400x300 and 640x400 resolutions.
        Fixed the crashes when using ALT-TAB to switch task.
	Added manual frameskip (keys + and -)
	Added command line options.
	Fixed problems with video cards that create non-linear surfaces (S3 Savage) (not fully fixed)
	Fixed the 3 punch in player 2 bug.
	Modified keypress detection. Now it's easy to make half circle moves.
	Added 2xSAI y Eagle. Removed the old interpolation modes.

1.0a	Fixed win95 crashes

1.0	First version.
