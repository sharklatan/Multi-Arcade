OTHER:

	Alternate rom directory: Allows an additional directory where to search for roms.
		Do not add the trailing backslash.
		You can use up to 10 rom directories, to switch between 
directory configuration use the < and > buttons next to 
the title (note that this is only for configuring the directories, 
Nebula will search roms in all directories configured, not only in
		the one you have currently selected). Nebula will search for roms
		the directories in the order they are stored, so you can use this as an
		advantage, for example you can have your original CPS2 dumps in a
		CD and the fixes/xor tables in your HD, if your HD path is written
		Before the CD path, then the newer roms will be read instead of the
		CD ones.

	Show only: Lets you filter the game list. 
  You can filter by available/missing xor/all  games and by system 
(CPS2, CPS1 or Neogeo).

	Skin Selection: 	Allows to change the current nebula skin. Skins must be in
			the SKINS\ directory and can have long (not very long) names.
	
Auto Save/Load:	Saves the game state when you exit the emulator and loads it
		again when you enter again (like if the arcade machine was not
		switched off)

Macros/Hints:	Enables the Macros and Hints (Hints are graphical help about 
		Moves)

GUI animations: Enables/disables animations in the gui. (for slow computers)
