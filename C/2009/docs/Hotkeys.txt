HOTKEYS

Hotkeys allow you to configure multiple button presses to a single button.

For Window GUI, Hotkeys are configured in the Player control configuration screen.

The button presses are configured in a file called HOTKEYS.DAT in the main
Nebula directory.

This is the default HOTKEYS.DAT file.

;Use values 1,2,3,4,5,6 for buttons and S for Start button

[Neogeo]
Hotkey1=1+2
Hotkey2=2+3
Hotkey3=3+4
Hotkey4=1+2+3
Hotkey5=2+3+4
Hotkey6=1+2+3+4

[CPS]
Hotkey1=1+2+3
Hotkey2=4+5+6
Hotkey3=3+6
Hotkey4=2+5
Hotkey5=1+4
Hotkey6=2+6

As you can notice you can configure up to 6 Hotkeys for each system (Neogeo and CPS).
The syntax is the same than for macros.

To assign a key to a Hotkey, use the CONTROLS panel in the main nebula window (scroll
down the control list)
