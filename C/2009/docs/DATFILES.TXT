ADDING ROMS

You can add new romsets by creating files in the directory ROMDATA.
The file structure is as follows: (ex: quiz nanairo dreams)

The filename must be the romset name ending in .dat: qndream.dat
And it's as follows:

Quiz Nanairo Dreams             		Description
                               			Parent romset (Empty if there is no parent)
tqzj.03,80000,7acf3e30          		Program roms: name,size in hex,crc in hex
tqzj.04,80000,f1044a87
tqzj.05,80000,4105ba0e
tqzj.06,80000,c371e8a5
Blank line
tqzjx.03,80000,5804a8f8         	Decryption tables
Blank line
tqz.14,200000,98af88a2,800000   	Graphics roms: 
tqz.16,200000,df82d491          	name,size,crc,load address (optional)
tqz.18,200000,42f132ff
tqz.20,200000,b2e128a3
Blank Line
tqz.01,20000,e9ce9d0a           	Z80 Roms
Blank Line
tqz.11,200000,78e7884f          	Sound roms
tqz.12,200000,2e049b13
Blank Line
3                               			Controller type (see below)
-1                              		Always a -1 in the last line

These are the controller types:
0       -       2 Players standard. sfa,ssf2,msh, etc
1       -       3 Players. avp
2       -       4 Players. ddtod
3       -       2 Players Quiz Nanairo

There is no need to add all the roms in games with a parent romset, only the different
roms are needed (but the blank line separator must be present)
If CRC is 0, it's not checked.
The parser is very simple, so the file structure must be exactly as described, with no 
spaces or extra characteres.
Graphics loading addresses must only appear (if needed) in the first ROM in each group of
four.
