MODIFYING NEBULA GUI

Now you can modify the nebula GUI. You can change the background graphics and the buttons.
You'll need some files (you can download the current gui files from the homepage):

	Inicio.wav			-	Sound played on startup
	Jugar.wav		-	Sound played when you hit the Play button
	Salir.wav			-	"	"	"   "   "     Quit Button
	Elige.wav			-	Sound played when you click a game name
	Clic.wav			-	Sound played when some buttons are pressed
	Pantalla.raw	640x480	- 	GUI background
	Botones.raw	400x300	-	GUI Buttons
	Fondo.raw	640x480	-	Rom loading background

*Logo.raw file is not needed anymore as it is included in the main exe.

All these files are RAW files. Using 3 bytes per pixel, in RGB format (interleaved). There is
no header. You can use those parameters to open them in your favourite graphics program.
There are some limitations to the graphics you can use. The background of the screenshot and
options zone should be black, due to the animations using black to clear this zone.
You must pack these 3 files in a ZIP file and put it in the SKINS\ directory
The entire gui zip file can't be bigger than 2MB.

If you want to convert the zip file to a internal (unpackable) format, you must rename your
zip file to gui.zip, put it in the Nebula folder and execute nebula -packgui. You'll get
a gui.dat file, copy it to the skins directory and rename to whatever name you want. Ensure
that you don't have two files with the same name (one .zip and the other .dat) otherwise
strange things could happen when Nebula tries to build the skin list.
