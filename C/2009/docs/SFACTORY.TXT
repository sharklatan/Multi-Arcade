SHOTS FACTORY (Only Window GUI)

Nebula 2.0 includes a new shot factory for all systems.
The shots factories are accessed from the Video Menu.

CPS1 & CPS2 shots factory

You'll be able to change the 3 layers position (X and Y register) and the
Drawing order (priority) 
Layer 2 Rowscroll can be disabled, but it can distort the background.

You can disable individual sprites. Select them from the list, and the
Sprite will blink in the main screen (You can select a range using Shift/
Control).


Neogeo
Neogeo is very different from CPS.
You'll notice the sprite map to the left. Each box represent a vertical stripe
in the screen:
 A gray square means that the strip is empty (not drawn)
A red square means that the strip is the beginning of a chain (or the
only strip in the chain).
A green square means a linked strip (linked to the last red square)

Double click on a square to disable it. Double click with the right mouse button
On a red square to disable all the chained (green) squares attached to it.

Some parameters affect the entire chain (X,Y, zoom Y) and some affect each
Individual strip (X zoom)
