NEOGEO CD

Starting with version 1.93, Nebula supports Neo·Geo CD console games

You’ll need a NeoGeo CD game in CD or in ISO format. ISO reader supports
Program only ISO tracks (.ISO) or CDRWin ISO+MP3 CD dumps (.CUE). CUE and
real CD games will have music. ISO program only games will have some music missing
due to the lack of the audio tracks in the image.

You’ll also need the NeoGeo CDZ bios (Neocd.bin) in a zip file called Neocd.zip in any of
the roms directories and also the NeoGeo bios (neogeo.zip).

The only supported BIOS file is:
NEOCD.BIN size 524288 bytes, CRC32: DF9DE490. 

Using a wrong NEOCD.BIN file may cause crashes.

Loading NeoGeo CD games:

To load a NeoGeo CD game you must start a game named “NeoGeo CD” in the Nebula 
game list. Neogeo CD is listed in the NeoGeo games list. This game will start the 
NeoGeo CD bios (like a real Neogeo CD). If you have already inserted a CD 
(or ISO Image), you can start the game by pressing the Start button or waiting till the 
Bios intro ends. If you press the A button, the CD Player will appear. 
To insert an ISO image or change the CD options, you must use the In-Game menus
that appear when you press the ESC key.

Special Neogeo CD Menus:
In the In-Game menus there is one option specific to Neogeo CD:

CD Options:
	Allows configuring the CD emulation (type, drive, iso file…)
- CD Mode: 
      Real CD: requires a Neogeo CD in your CD Drive.
An option to configure the CD drive will appear below.
      
ISO Image: It will load a CD image from an ISO or CUE file.
Press Enter in the “Select ISO Image” option to open the file browser
to select the image you want to load.
		

Neogeo CD is a “dynamic RAM” system (that is no fixed data in ROMS, the needed data is
copied from CD to RAM when needed) so no savestates are available yet (and if they are
available some day, they will be very big, about 8 MB of RAM must be saved)
